This repository contains a deep learning model built with PyTorch to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model is trained to recognize clothing items such as shirts, shoes, bags, and more — offering a more challenging alternative to traditional digit classification.

🧠 Features:
PyTorch-based implementation
Supports fully connected and/or convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
Training and evaluation scripts
Accuracy and loss visualization
Clean, modular code for easy experimentation and customization

📁 Project Structure:
model.py – Defines the neural network architecture
train.py – Training script with loss tracking
test.py – Evaluation script for model performance
utils.py – (Optional) Helper functions like plotting or saving models
README.md – Documentation and setup instructions

🧪 Dataset:
Fashion MNIST: A dataset of Zalando's article images — 10 categories, 70,000 grayscale images.
